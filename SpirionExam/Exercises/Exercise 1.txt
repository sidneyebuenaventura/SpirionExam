The differences in public, private, protected and internal modifiers are:

For public modifier the access is not restricted which means that it can be accessed by other code in the program.
	For Example: 
		class A
		{
			public int x;
		}
		class program
		{
			static void main()
			{
				var a = new A();
				a.x = 10;
			}
		}
While internal modifier can be accessed within the same assembly file.

On the other hand, protected modifier is accessible within the derived class.
	For Example:
		class A
		{
			protected int x;
		}
		class B : A
		{
			static void main()
			{
				var a = new A();
				var b = new B();
				// this will throw an error because the variable is 
				// declared as a protected member of base class
				a.x = 10;
				// x can only be accessed by class B.
				b.x = 5;
			}
		}
 
Lastly, private modifier the access is limited, meaning that it can be only accessed in the same class or structure
	For Example: 
		class A
		{
			private int x;
		}
		class program
		{
			static void main()
			{
				var a = new A();
				// this will throw an error because x is private
				a.x = 10;
			}
		}
